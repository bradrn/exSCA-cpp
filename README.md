# exSCA
An extended version of Mark Rosenfelder's Sound Change Applier

## Downloads
Download executables via the releases page.

The latest release is [**Version 2.1.1**](https://github.com/bradrn/exSCA-cpp/releases).
The installer is named `exSCA-setup-2.1.1-x64.exe`.

Unfortunately, exSCA-cpp is currently only available under Windows, and even then only for x64 computers.
Hopefully I will be able to compile exSCA for Ubuntu and x86 soon, but unfortunately I do not anticipate a Mac version any time soon.

## Qt
exSCA-cpp uses the Qt library, licensed under the LGPL license.
